Specifically, AI is being used to perform workplace tasks by either augmenting or automating human labor. People seek to use generative AI to produce writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products, which distinguishes it from traditional web search engines. Users interact with AI with different intents, including asking for information or advice, doing tasks that produce output, and expressing themselves. Additionally, AI can serve as a co-worker producing output or as a co-pilot improving human productivity and problem-solving. Some uses involve relationships, personal reflection, games and role play, therapy, and companionship. Overall, generative AI is highly flexible and increasingly integrated into economic and occupational activities.'"
