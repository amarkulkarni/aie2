        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

We analyze more than 80 commercial and\\nnon-commercial implementations that have emerged since 2023, including\\nOpenAI/Deep Research, Gemini/Deep Research, Perplexity/Deep Research, and\\nnumerous open-source alternatives. Through comprehensive examination, we\\npropose a novel hierarchical taxonomy that categorizes systems according to\\nfour fundamental technical dimensions: foundation models and reasoning engines,\\ntool utilization and environmental interaction, task planning and execution\\ncontrol, and knowledge synthesis and output generation. We explore the\\narchitectural patterns, implementation approaches, and domain-specific\\nadaptations that characterize these systems across academic, scientific,\\nbusiness, and educational applications. Our analysis reveals both the\\nsignificant capabilities of current implementations and the technical and\\nethical challenges they present regarding information accuracy, privacy,\\nintellectual property, and accessibility. The survey concludes by identifying\\npromising research directions in advanced reasoning architectures, multimodal\\nintegration, domain specialization, human-AI collaboration, and ecosystem\\nstandardization that will likely shape the future evolution of this\\ntransformative technology. By providing a comprehensive framework for\\nunderstanding Deep Research systems, this survey contributes to both the\\ntheoretical understanding of AI-augmented knowledge work and the practical\\ndevelopment of more capable, responsible, and accessible research technologies.\\nThe paper resources can be viewed at\\nhttps://github.com/scienceaix/deepresearch.\\n\\nPublished: 2021-03-05\\nTitle: A comprehensive survey on point cloud registration\\nAuthors: Xiaoshui Huang, Guofeng Mei, Jian Zhang, Rana Abbas\\nSummary: Registration is a transformation estimation problem between two point clouds,\\nwhich has a unique and critical role in numerous computer vision applications.\\nThe developments of optimization-based methods and deep learning methods have\\nimproved registration robustness and efficiency. Recently, the combinations of\\noptimization-based and deep learning methods have further improved performance.\\nHowever, the connections between optimization-based and deep learning methods\\nare still unclear. Moreover, with the recent development of 3D sensors and 3D\\nreconstruction techniques, a new research direction emerges to align\\ncross-source point clouds. This survey conducts a comprehensive survey,\\nincluding both same-source and cross-source registration methods, and summarize\\nthe connections between optimization-based and deep learning methods, to\\nprovide further research insight. This survey also builds a new benchmark to\\nevaluate the state-of-the-art registration algorithms in solving cross-source\\nchallenges.

            "Context Engineering is a relatively new and emerging field that focuses on designing, managing, and utilizing contextual information to improve the functionality and user experience of systems, applications, and devices. It involves understanding and manipulating the context in which interactions occur‚Äîsuch as location, time, user activity, environment, and social factors‚Äîto create more intelligent, adaptive, and personalized solutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The concept of Context Engineering gained prominence with the rise of ubiquitous computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and pervasive sensing technologies in the early 2010s. It became particularly relevant as organizations and developers sought ways to make systems more responsive and relevant to users' needs by leveraging contextual data.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the idea of context-aware computing has been around since the late 1990s and early 2000s, the term \"Context Engineering\" itself started to gain traction around the mid-2010s as a formal discipline and approach within the broader fields of human-computer interaction (HCI), ubiquitous computing, and AI.\n",

This process involves adjusting the model's parameters slightly to improve its performance on the target task, leveraging the knowledge the model has already acquired during its initial training.\n",

These agents can be used in applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, automated customer support, and more complex decision-making systems.\n",
